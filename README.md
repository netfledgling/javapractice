# Java Practice
This is a place where I'll be storing whatever code I'm working on as part of my Java programming practice.

I'll be categorizing problems based on either-typically both- 1) where the problem is sourced from, or 2) what purpose the problem served. 

Folders and sub-folders are:
- Competitive Programming
  - CodeForces
- Job Hunt
  - LeetCode
  - HackerRank
- Misc (for anything that may not apply to aforementioned categories)
  - DSA practice (dsa)
  
The actual code files can be navigated to within the respective folders.
